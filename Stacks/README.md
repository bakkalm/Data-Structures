# Analysis of Stack

A data structure (or DSA) is a way we store and organize our data. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.

A Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The last element that is placed in a stack is the first element that can be removed. Elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top.
The insertion of an element into stack is called pushing. Deletion of an element from the stack is called popping. In stacks, The last element in a list is tracked with a pointer called top.

Popping an element from a stack will take O(1) time complexity. Popping the last element in a stack will take O(n).
