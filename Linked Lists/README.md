# Analysis of Linked List

Singly Linked Lists are a type of data structure. A linked list provides an alternative to an array-based structure.
A linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively form linear sequence.
Unlike an array, the size of a linked list can change dynamically.
However, to access an element from a linked list, we might traverse to the entire list, so accessing an element takes O(n) time. Inserting is also O(n) operation because we need to traverse the entire list when the node to be operated is at the last of the linked list.
